# Aura Hub

Aura Hub is a social media platform designed to boost productivity with a suite of features:

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Connect and communicate with others instantly.
- **Flashcards**: Create and share flashcards with a scrolling mechanism.
- **Focus Timers**: Boost your productivity with focus timers.
- **Hubs**: Use focus timers together and share educational resources, similar to Discord servers.

Additionally, Aura Hub includes an innovative feature to manage screen time:

- **Screen Time Management**: Block certain apps to manage your screen time. Share your screen time usage with friends or followers to encourage mindful device use.

As a solo developer, I aim to keep the scope manageable but have more features planned for future updates.
